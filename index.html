            <p>Activities: Review 3-5 pre-defined key metrics from your company scorecard. Briefly compare actual performance against targets. Identify any significant deviations and note areas requiring deeper discussion later.</p>

            <p>Activities: Briefly review each Rock (typically 3-7 quarterly priorities). Clearly state whether each Rock is "on track" or "off track." For off-track Rocks, discuss roadblocks and potential solutions.</p>

            <p>Purpose: Recognize and celebrate instances where team members embodied the company's core values.</p>

            <p><strong>6. IDS (Identify, Discuss, Solve) (60 minutes):</strong></p>
            <p>Purpose: This is the heart of the L10 meeting, dedicated to tackling the most pressing issues.</p>

Discuss Issues: Analyze each issue from different angles to understand its root cause. Solve Issues: Collaboratively develop solutions and action plans to address the problems. Prioritization: Rank issues based on their potential impact and urgency.</p>

            <p><strong>7. Conclusion (5 minutes):</strong></p>
            <p>Purpose: Summarize key takeaways and next steps.</p>
            <p>Activities: Briefly recap the main decisions and action items from the meeting. Assign someone to take minutes and distribute them to the team. Optional: Collectively rate the meeting on a scale (e.g., 1-10) to identify areas for improvement.</p>
